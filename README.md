# Books and board games rental

As I'm student of IT for economics, I had Java programming exercises. 
At the end of these exercises there was a credit where I had to programme a simple rental for board games and books in a console. 

I have decided to recreate this project in Node.js. I tried it programme in OOP paradigm.

## Installation
